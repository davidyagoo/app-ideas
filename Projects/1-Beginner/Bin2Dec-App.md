# Bin2Dec

**等級:** 1-初學者

二進位制是所有數位電腦的基礎數字系統。 
因此，對於開發人員來說，理解二進位制或二進位制數學非常重要。 
Bin2dec 的目的是提供如何進行二進位制運算的實踐和理解。

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's
and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

-   Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the
    sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for
    example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function
    to use.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
-   [ ] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
-   [ ] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can enter a variable number of binary digits
